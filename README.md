# MSD-Web-Core

MaX Saxe Design has decided to make a free public devlopment version of the MaX Saxe Design Web Core.

This can be used to host a few subdomains to test the system and make updates to the MaX Saxe Design Web Core open source project, which is a break or fork from the main MSD Web Core, which is available to request to download from downloads.webcore.maxsaxedesign.co.uk.
